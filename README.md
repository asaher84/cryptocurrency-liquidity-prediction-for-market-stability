##Cryptocurrency Liquidity Prediction for Market Stability
#Overview
This project focuses on predicting liquidity in the cryptocurrency market to enhance market stability and inform trading decisions.

Features
Data Collection: Utilized APIs and data scraping techniques to gather real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data.

Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, handled missing values, and normalized features.

Modeling: Implemented machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest) to forecast liquidity based on historical data.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Considered deployment strategies for real-time predictions and scalability.

Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras

APIs: (List APIs used for data collection)

Usage
Environment Setup: Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt.

Data Collection: Run scripts (data_collection.py) to fetch cryptocurrency data from APIs.

Preprocessing: Execute preprocessing steps (preprocessing.ipynb) to clean and prepare data for modeling.

Model Training: Train models (model_training.ipynb) and evaluate their performance.

Deployment: Discuss deployment options for integrating predictions into trading platforms or decision-making tools.

Future Improvements
Include more cryptocurrency pairs for broader market coverage.

Enhance model robustness with ensemble techniques.

Implement advanced data streaming for real-time predictions.
